Personalization is one of the surest ways to improve your guest experience. The more you can customize a stay, the more welcome and appreciated that guest will feel. Adding custom graphics and offering special extras that appeal to your guests sense of place segments can make a big difference. Consider partnering with local businesses like your local or regional tourist boards, activity providers and gear rental companies to offer your guests memorable experiences. Customizing a guestâ€™s stay with personalized items and services can greatly enhance their experience and create unique and impactful experiences that keep travelers coming back time and time again.
