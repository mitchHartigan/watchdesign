### Why invest in custom decorated Guest and In-Room Amenities? BECAUSE IT WORKS!

- 50% of U.S consumers who receive a health and safety product state they have a more favorable opinion of the experience after receiving, 27% carry it with them after receiving and 85% of customers remember the name on the product.

- Nearly six in seven (85%) of recipients can identify the name on promotional products they own. Additionally, those same recipients report overwhelmingly positive feelings about the advertiser

- Custom amenities are used multiple times per day and can be kept for 2+ years. ADDITIONALLY, these products are passed along – nearly two-thirds are given away after the original recipient is finished using the item.

- Make in Impression! Bags, the most effective impression maker, generate 5,700+ impressions, on average. Drinkware is used 2-3 times per week. Pens, are used 3-4 times per day over their lifetime resulting in a cost of 1/10th of a cent per impression!

- This information is based on the Global Advertising Specialties Impressions Study (conducted with 2,674 respondents in the United States, 48% Male, 52% Female, 57% of the total over 35 years old).

### How to design your amenities?

- Guest Amenities that can be used for reference are more highly valued. Names, contact info., social media sites, QR codes all provide value far in excess of the item itself. We believe this is a bedrock approach.

- When providing “take away” amenities, Usefulness is key – Bags, Drinkware, Health/Safety and Pens are among the longest kept and most used promotional products.

- Develop an identity and style – Create a brand identity by using an image. Use fonts and color in a consistent way. Make the color and tonality of the products communicate how you want to be perceived – Fun? Private? Spa Like? Exciting? One key rule – Keep it simple. Not only does busy branding often not look as good when printed, but a clean and simple look creates products that recipients are more likely to use and use longer.
